  <p class="content">BSP Camp Malagos, October 25-28, 2024 –
The Senior Scouts of Soledad R. Duterte National 
High School (SRDNHS) showcased their exceptional skills and teamwork at the Council Scout 
Jamboree, securing second place in the highly 
competitive First Aid and Rescue Olympics. Held 
at BSP Camp Malagos from October 25-28, 2024, 
the event tested the scouts' ability to respond 
effectively to emergency situations, demonstrating their preparedness and commitment to disaster response</p>
  <p class="content">The journey to victory was not easy. The SRDNHS 
Senior Scouts dedicated months of preparation 
to mastering first aid techniques, rescue strategies, and emergency response protocols. Under 
the guidance of Ryan Jude Tanjay, the head of 
Compass of Baliok, the scouts received expert 
training, refining their skills and improving their 
teamwork. Louie Jay Onso, a member of Compass 
and the Senior Crew Leader (SCL) of SRDNHS, 
played a crucial role in mentoring the team, ensuring they were well-equipped for the competition.</p>
  <p class="content">To maximize their chances of winning, the team 
selected only the most experienced and physically fit scouts for the competition. The lineup included <em>Mary Rose Colon, Gian Andrei Romarate, 
Joven Alberto Samsonite, Vince Dominic Sayritan, 
Xander Vince Militares, Ken Carlo Matanog, John 
Lloyd Onso, and Nhikel Pedrico</em>. Each member was 
assigned specific roles, with two rescuers, one 
captain, six medics, and two compressors to 
ensure an efficient and effective response.</p>
  <p class="content">The scouts commenced their intensive training on October 6, 2024, focusing on essential skills 
such as knot-tying for bandages and anchoring, as 
well as refining their rescue techniques. The first 
few days of practice were challenging, with time 
management proving to be a crucial factor in scoring. To optimize their training sessions, the scouts 
were excused from regular classes, dedicating 
their afternoons to rigorous practice under the 
supervision of BSP Coordinator Sir Rex Corporal 
Estrebillo. As training progressed, the team significantly improved their efficiency, reducing errors 
and sharpening their execution.</p>
   <p class="content">A sudden rescheduling of the First Aid and Rescue 
Olympics from October 27 to October 25 posed an 
unexpected challenge for the team. Determined to 
adapt, the scouts utilized the entire morning of 
October 24 for final rehearsals, ensuring they 
were mentally and physically prepared for the 
competition. Compass of Baliok provided crucial 
last-minute support, rushing to Camp Malagos with 
essential equipment to assist the team.</p>
   <p class="content">Before their departure, the SRDNHS community, 
including Principal Maria Teresa Carbon and fellow 
students, sent off the scouts with warm wishes and 
words of encouragement. The team, along with 
their BSP Coordinator and a total of 20 participants, traveledfrom Baliok to Camp Malagos
in an L300 van, carrying all their camping and 
competition essentials. They arrived at the camp 
around 5 PM and settled in their designated 
campsite, where they were grouped with scouts 
from San Miguel Integrated School, Dr. P. Ocampo 
College Davao Campus, Baracayo Integrated 
School, and Gasco & Centina Integrated School.</p>
   <p class="content">Despite the challenges, the SRDNHS Senior Scouts showcased exceptional performance during the 
competition, earning them a well-deserved second
-place finish. Their dedication, strategic preparation, and teamwork proved invaluable in securing 
this victory, reinforcing their commitment to 
emergency preparedness and first aid excellence.</p>
  <p class="content'">Their achievement stands as a testament to their 
perseverance and the support of their mentors, 
school, and community. The SRDNHS Senior Scouts 
continue to inspire, setting a high standard for 
future scouting competitions and emergency response training.</p>

   <h5>Qoute:</h5>
   <p class="qoute">“Winning the First Aid Rescue Olympics was an
overwhelming and unexpected moment for me as a
leader. Throughout the competition, pressure
weighed heavily on my shoulders, I had doubts, and
the fear of failure loomed over me. Our team faced
strong competitors, and I constantly questioned
whether we had prepared enough. Despite this, I
knew I had to remain composed and encourage my
teammates, even when uncertainty crept in. Winning
this competition was not just a victory, it was a
reminder that challenges can turn into triumphs
when faced with courage and unity"</p>
