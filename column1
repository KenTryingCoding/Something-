    <h1>If Uniqueness is a good thing, why are students so violent about it?</h1>
    <h2>By:Kenjie G. Hatague</h2>
    <p>Individualism is a wonderful thing, uniqueness makes room for creativity yet it is something that many students end up disagreeing on. Society thrives on cooperation yet it has turned into something that is nothing less than unproductive, Herd Mentality. It refers to the tendency of a group of people to want to be just like each other to the point that if someone in the group starts to be different from the rest, the entire group turns their back on them.</p>
<p>Soledad R. Duterte National High School is filled with students that are no different to regular humans. And so, they fall prey to the same Herd Mentality that consumes all of society. The students are close-knit to their friend groups but are hostile to other friend groups who don't fit with their vibe. It is sickening how a plague that's been tormenting society is still present among the youth and is likely to be present for more youth in the future. Humanity will continue to be plagued by this disease and the youth will be no exception to it.</p>
 <p>Fitting in with the masses is a hard thing, and the students’ of the Herd Mentality are making it even more difficult. Nobody seems to be seeing the problem and to those who do, they end up not doing anything about it. I have seen many who tried to fit in with the popular kids and be with the people who everyone likes. These students end up being pushed out for being “weird” or just outright not passing their view of someone “normal”. I am one of the students that the popular kids view as weird or abnormal. It has been hard on me to hear all the words coming out of their mouths behind my back and I know that it's hard for most of the people who are like me too. I end up befriending those kids who are pushed away by the masses and to me, they are also nothing more than normal humans. They too might be a bit different, but I see that they're human too, which is something that most people don't see or just don't want to see.</p>
<p>Neurodiversity is one of the most common reasons as to why some students end up being incapable of fitting in. It is when someone's brain functions differently to the regular human. It may be caused by a genetic disorder, a medical condition, or traumatic experiences. These people are considered neurodivergent and they are often shunned upon and bullied. It is wrong to blame someone for something that they cannot control. It is not their fault that they have these problems yet instead of supporting them, students just end up bullying them which causes a lot of distress. I have classmates with Neurodivergent behavior and they are often pushed away by the rest of the class since almost nobody wants to work for them. This pushes for an environment where they cannot possibly fit in with the rest of the class.</p>
<p>We humans are not sheep. We may be social, but each of us has our own identity that should be appreciated and respected. I see a lot of room for improvement in this school filled with students who have a strong sense of community but until we learn to appreciate the creative implications of Individualism, we'll forever be stuck on the same Herd Mentality that's been plaguing us. Some students may be a bit weird but that's their identity, what makes them stand out among the sea of sheep that cannot appreciate change. These traits that make us unique are blessings that we should cherish. As the saying goes, <em>“Even ants can love one another for being similar, we humans should step it up and love each other for being different”</em>(H.K Glorio, 2025)</p>
